# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Brazil Forest Fires Dataset

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Brazil Forest Fires** dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset provides data on forest fires across various states of Brazil from 1998 to 2017. Using Python's data analysis libraries, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights related to the occurrence of forest fires over time.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization
- datetime: Time-series data handling

## Key Analysis Questions:
1. Display top 5 and last 5 rows of the dataset
2. Shape and structure of the dataset
3. Check for and remove duplicates and null values
4. Rename months to English
5. Analyze total fires reported across years and states
6. Identify the month, year, and state with the highest number of fires
7. Detailed year-wise and day-wise analysis for Amazonas
8. Visualize fire occurrences in 2015 by month
9. State-wise analysis of average number of fires
10. Identify states with fires reported in December

## Key Insights:
- August had the highest number of fires reported.
- 2010 was the year with the most forest fires.
- Amazonas reported the highest number of fires over the years.

This project showcases how EDA can help in understanding patterns in real-world datasets and provides a foundation for future predictive modeling.
